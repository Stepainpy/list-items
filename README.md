# List items
This program written using the PyQt5 library allows you to create a list of items. There is a list with the names of items, a list of item tags and fields with a description of it. After you have created an item and given it a description with tags, click on the "Save item" button, so after closing the program and launching it later, the data will be saved in a json file.
